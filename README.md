## Installation
**Hello! On this part we will show you how to install Bulba :O  
First things first, You need NodeJS 6+ Well Obviously.**  


**Now since the command `git@github.com:bouleytator/bulba-discordbot.git` is not working, we need to do it Manually.   
Download the files; once you've done that, move/upload it to a VPS or your PC.  
Now that we've done that. Open CMD and type `cd path/to/your/bot/folder` Now, once you're in the Folder, make sure you have NodeJS 6+ installed. Now we've done that. We're seperating the two Guides!**  

### Windows
**- *WARNING!* :** **This guide is only for Windows 7 or above!** 

**Install NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org), Now that you've done that do `npm install discord-js --save` on the Command Prompt. After that do `npm install fs --save` And lastly, rename `settings_exmample.json` to `settings.json`.**

### Linux
**- *WARNING!* :** **This Guide is only for Linux ( Any Version ) only.**

**Install NodeJS by doing on Linux, ( We don't have a guide ) now that you've installed it. Since we have the files on a folder. Do `npm install discord.js --save` and `npm install fs --save` and lastly rename `settings_example.json` to `settings.json`.**
