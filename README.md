# Bulba Discord Bot

**Hello! Welcome to Bulba's Official and Public Release.**  
User: Uhm, what can i find here exactly?  
Admin: Oh! Here you can find/use **Bulba** for free.   


## Installation
**Hello! On this part we will show you how to install Bulba :O  
First things first, You need NodeJS 6+ Well Obviously.  

Now since the command `git@github.com:bouleytator/bulba-discordbot.git` is not working, we need to do it Manually.   
Download the files; once you've done that, move/upload it to a VPS or your PC.  
Now that we've done that. Open CMD and type `cd path/to/your/bot/folder` Now,**
